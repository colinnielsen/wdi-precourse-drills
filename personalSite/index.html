      <p>Hey! My name is Colin!</p>
      <p>I'm a 20 year old guy who has spent the last 8 years living in the burbs down in Highlands Ranch. I just moved up to Denver and I've been loving it.
      Before that, I lived out on the East Coast. I was born in Arlington, VA (just right out side of D.C) and then moved up to Jersey City, NJ (just right outside of NYC)
      I currently live by myself now. My Fiance's name is Marrah and she lives with her cat Nala ( she really really loves cats. ) </p>

      <p>Previous to arriving here at Galvanize, I tried making freelance photography work as a profession, but I quickly realized that I wanted to be able to afford having
      more than a 2 week old bagel sitting at the back of my empty fridge. Even though I wont be a photographer per se, the art I make is so very important to me. </p>
